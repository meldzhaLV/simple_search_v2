## Simple Search v2

Simple Search is a basic program written in Python for automating `.docx` file editing.
It helps you change a word or a text in the documents to the desired word or text. 
It means that you don't have to open each `.docx` file to change text in all of those files.
You can simply use 'SimpleSearch'.

1. There is a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) where you can select the desired folder with your `.docx` files.
2. There are 2 entry fields - 
- You have to type which text or word has to be changed 
- You have to type to what word or text it should be changed
3. Press 'Apstiprinat' and there you go.
